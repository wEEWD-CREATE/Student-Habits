## 1. Introduction

üîç Problem Description

In the digital age, students are increasingly exposed to various lifestyle choices that may influence their academic performance. Factors such as screen time, sleep habits, mental health, physical activity, and study routines all contribute to student success or struggle. However, it is unclear which of these factors have the most signficant impact on academic outcomes like GPA.
  
üéØ Objective

This analysis aims to explore and identify the key lifestyle factors that influence students' academic performance, measured by their exam scores. By leveraging data visualization and statistical techniques (including correlation and regression analysis), the goal is to uncover patterns and relationships between GPA and daily habits such as Netflix usage, TikTok time, sleep duration, diet quality and more.

Ultimately, this project provides data-driven insights to inform healthier habits and better academic planning for students.
